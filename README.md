# liri-node-app
This app is supposed to display either a movie, concerts or data related to a song based on user entry. 
However, for now it displays three results for one entry. You can see the results in the Issues with
Bob Dylan as an example.

There are more examples in the issues in this GitHub Repo. 

This app uses Node.js and npm packages like Axios. 
The code was inspired by the Northwestern Bootcamp. However, all bugs are my responsibility.
